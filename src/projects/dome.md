## Project Overview

As the first hire at Elexa Consumer Products, I assumed responsibilities encompassing a wide range of skills and played an instrumental role in bringing the Dome product line to market.<!-- end --> My primary contributions to Dome were in product design and specification, documentation, and digital marketing.

## Product Design and Specification

I joined Elexa shortly before the Dome product line launched. I was responsible for the industrial design for the <a target="_blank" href="https://domeha.com/z-wave-water-main-shut-off-valve">Water Main Shut-Off</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://domeha.com/z-wave-door-and-window-sensor-pro">Door/Window Sensor Pro</a>.

Along with physical product design, I specified software functionality for Dome devices. I worked within the Z-Wave specification to maximize the features available to users (without adding to hardware costs,) including working with Sigma Designs (then-owner and overseer of Z-Wave technology) to add to the Z-Wave standard to support new device features, such as pest detection in the <a target="_blank" href="https://domeha.com/z-wave-mouse-trap">Mouser</a> and multi-tone chime functionality in the <a target="_blank" href="https://domeha.com/z-wave-siren-sensor">Siren</a>.

## Product Documentation

To facilitate integration of Dome devices with established home automation platforms such as Samsung SmartThings and Wink, I set a goal to create the most detailed and easiest to work with documenation on the market. According to unsolicited feedback from Dome's integration partners, the goal was met.

The docs are <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.domeha.com">available online</a>.

## Digital Marketing

I cultivated the Dome brand's voice and online reputation. I crafted virtually all of the outward facing copy, owing to my understanding of our products and ability to explain it using approachable and engaging language. My work can still be seen live on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.domeha.com">Dome website</a>.
